Zaafir C,"Nice video Krish!

A small clarification for your viewers, we never say: ""Accept the null hypothesis""
We should rather say ""fail to reject"".

The sample test is not evidence proving the null.
The sample test should always be considered as evidence disproving the null.
If the sample test result is strong enough, then we are successful in disproving the null, ""Reject the null hypothesis"".
if the sample test result is not strong enough, then we have not been successful in disproving the null, ""fail to reject the null hypothesis"".


An analogy can be:

Ho: Krish is innocent
H1: Krish is guilty

Sample test: Compare krish's fingerprints with fingerprints found on crime scene

If fingerprints match, we have strong evidence from sample test that krish was on crime scene, so we ""reject the null that he is innocent""

However, if fingerprints do not match, we do not have strong evidence that krish was on crime scene, so we ""fail to reject null that he is innocent""

Here, again, we do not know that he is actually innocent. Our test does not prove his innocence. Our test is just not strong enough to prove that he is guilty. (who knows he might have wore gloves :) )",2022-07-19T12:17:57Z,2022-07-19T12:17:57Z,24,1,[]
